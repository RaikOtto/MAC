To do list:
2. MA has only Keq, not Vm - unclear
4. LibSbml only version 2.4
5. Mysterious example with one liner does not work. double activation and inhibition
6. VM values dont appear in Parafile - okay?
7. Check for false input e.g. division by zero
8. SBML - change NT matrix - 2' ATP, 2' ADP
9. Stoichiometry only works up to 9 -> change

Done since 28_02_12:
- Changed error message on LibSBML
- switched EE*N to N*EE in Jacobi file
- Corrected Jacobian Matrix -> deleted REGA/REGI Terms in the product rule
- Inserted Parafile into Sim file and removed the Parafile from the network directory
- Removed KMR and KMM vectors from parafile
- Removed Jacobi link at the end of the simulation part
- Added checks for VM, S0, X0, concentration

Done since 29_01_12:
- added check if libSBML is installed, if not: error message
- Kix and Kax default in default.py added
- Kix and Kax modifiable by txt comman +n3S4_2 -> KAX = 2
- Fixed Kix and Kax reaction number problem
- SBML contains the manually set KAX and KIX values
- Added VM defaults - currently fixed to 1
- Added VM user defined values, appear in SBML and in the Sim file
- Added warning if a reaction contains an external metabolite and reaction type is nor irreversible, as well it changes the reaction type to reaction_type + 'IR'
